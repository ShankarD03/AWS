Executive Summary:
Purpose of the Document : Traffic congestion is a persistent issue in
many urban areas, leading to wasted time, fuel, and increased pollution. Effective traffic
detection systems can help manage congestion by providing real-time data and
optimizing traffic flow. Road safety is a paramount concern. Traffic detection systems
can monitor traffic for accidents, erratic driving behavior, or other safety hazards,
enabling quicker responses from emergency services. Efficient traffic management can
reduce travel times and fuel consumption, benefiting both individuals and businesses.
Traffic detection systems can help optimize signal timings and route traffic efficiently.
Overview of the AWS Solution: Building a traffic detection application
solution on Amazon Web Services (AWS) involves designing and implementing an
architecture that can collect, process, and analyze traffic data efficiently. Using some of
the AWS services like Dynamodb, Lambda, EC2 ,EMR,S3.
Key Benefits of AWS: Scalability, Reliability and High Availability, Global
Reach,Cost Efficiency ,Variety of Services, Flexibility, Machine Learning and AI, Quick
Deployment.
Project Scope:
The project aims to develop a real-time traffic detection application using
AWS, focusing on improving traffic safety, optimizing congestion management, and
enhancing overall transportation efficiency within a defined urban area.The scope
encompasses the collection and analysis of traffic data from various sources,
integration with existing transportation systems, and the deployment of a user-friendly
application.

Justification for Service Selection:
EC2:
1. Amazon EC2 provides scalable compute resources for processing real-time traffic
data, accommodating fluctuations in demand and ensuring timely data analysis.
2. EC2 instances offer flexibility to customize the application's architecture, deploy
specific software components, and efficiently manage compute resources for traffic
detection and analytics.
S3:
Amazon S3 is used in the traffic detection application to securely and cost-effectively
store and manage large volumes of traffic data, making it easily accessible for analysis
and ensuring data durability and scalability.
Lambda:
Using AWS Lambda in the traffic detection application enables cost-efficient, serverless,
event-driven data processing, ensuring optimal resource allocation and scalability while
minimizing operational overhead.The purpose of using Lambda between EC2 and
DynamoDB is to facilitate serverless data processing, enabling real-time traffic data
analysis, transformation, and seamless integration with DynamoDB for efficient and
scalable data storage.
Relational Database Service(RDS):
Using Amazon RDS (Relational Database Service) for the traffic detection application
provides a scalable and fully managed database solution, ensuring efficient storage and
retrieval of metadata and configuration data, while offloading database management
tasks and enhancing application reliability.
EMR:
Amazon EMR (Elastic MapReduce) can efficiently process and analyze large volumes of
traffic data, making it ideal for a traffic detection application. Its distributed computing
capabilities and compatibility with various big data tools enable timely insights and
real-time traffic management, improving overall road safety and transportation
efficiency.
Amplify:
Amplify simplifies and accelerates the development of the traffic detection application
on AWS by providing a comprehensive set of tools and services for building and
deploying scalable, secure, and responsive applications.Amplify also offers features for
authentication, real-time data synchronization, and robust back-end services, reducing
development time and effort while ensuring seamless user experiences.
Athena:
Athena, an AWS service, is beneficial for the traffic detection application due to its
efficient query performance and cost-effectiveness in analyzing large datasets, allowing
for real-time traffic insights and data-driven decision-making.
Map box:
Mapbox is utilized in this traffic detection application for its robust mapping and
geospatial capabilities, enabling real-time visualization of traffic data, advanced route
optimization, and geospatial analysis, enhancing the application's overall effectiveness
in traffic management.
Pelias:
Pelias, a geocoding and search engine, is ideal for a traffic detection application due to
its robust location data capabilities and geospatial search features, enabling precise
and efficient analysis of traffic patterns, incident detection, and routing optimization.
Deployment Process:
● Utilize AWS Elastic Beanstalk or Amazon EC2 for hosting the application code
and AWS RDS for database storage, configuring security groups, IAM roles, and
auto-scaling as needed.
● Leverage AWS CloudFormation or Terraform for infrastructure as code (IAC) to
automate resource provisioning and deployment, ensuring scalability, high
availability, and efficient project management.
● To deploy the web application on AWS, use AWS Elastic Beanstalk for
streamlined deployment and scaling, or AWS EC2 instances with web servers and
databases for more custom control and flexibility.
